# Typing-Race-Login-And-Data-Server

Demo Video: https://youtu.be/MvyhU7ZtN7w

The purpose of this server is to handle users signing up, logging in, their leaderboard and win/loss data, and requesting matches.

It is built using the Java EE framework and Apache Tomcat.
This server is currently unfinished and only has the functionality to test the game server, but I'm working on porting existing code from another project to finish it.
